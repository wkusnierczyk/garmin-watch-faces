 ### Availability

The watch faces are available from the [Garmin Connect IQ Developer portal](https://apps.garmin.com/developer/84aa79b0-5787-481d-bb10-8c5015ac1158/apps).  

All faces were developed as open-source projects, and are available from GitHub. See links in the table below.

|Resource|Description|
|:-|:-|
|[Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)|The watch faces use open source fonts, downloaded from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as True Type (scalable) fonts.|
|[`ttf2bmp`](https://github.com/wkusnierczyk/ttf2bmp)|Most Garmin watches do not support scalable fonts, and require bitmap fonts with specific sizes instead. For projects listed here, TTF fonts were converted to bitmaps (`.fnt` font description and `.png` font image files) using the open source tool [`ttf2bmp`](https://github.com/wkusnierczyk/ttf2bmp).|
|[`garmin-font-scaler`](https://github.com/wkusnierczyk/garmin-font-scaler)|To adapt the non-scalable bitmap fonts to various screen resolutions and shapes, the fonts were scaled using `ttf2bmp` with the open source automation tool [`garmin-font-scaler`](https://github.com/wkusnierczyk/garmin-font-scaler).|
